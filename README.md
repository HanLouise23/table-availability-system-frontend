# table-availability-system-frontend
Table Availability System created for TM470 - The computing and IT project

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Setup

1. Install Node.js - Go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and download the LTS version.
2. Validate with `node -v` and `npm -v` in the command line.

### Running the project

1. In command line, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <path>\table-availability-system-frontend\
```
Where `<path>` is the path to the project directory.

2. Add a `.env.development` file in the root of the project with the following content:
```
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
```

3. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Confirm your browser and if it’s loading http://localhost:5173

## Structure

- routes/ = route wrappers that load data and render a component
- components/ = reusable/pure-ish UI pieces (RestaurantCard, RestaurantDetails, Header, SearchForm, etc.)
- layouts/ = shared UI shells (MainLayout)
- models/ = shared TS types
- types/ = cross-cutting types (like the outlet context)

## Testing

This project uses the following testing libraries:

- `jest` → the testing framework
- `@types/jest` → TypeScript typings for Jest
- `ts-jest` → allows Jest to compile .ts and .tsx files
- `jest-environment-jsdom` → simulates a browser-like DOM environment for React components
- `identity-obj-proxy` → shim to mock CSS/SCSS modules so Jest doesn’t crash on imports

To run the tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```

### Code Coverage
To generate a code coverage report in the console, run:
```bash
npm run test:cov
```
For HTML report, run:
```bash
npm run coverage:open
```

### Config
- `jest.config.cjs` → Jest configuration file (Note: this is a CommonJS file, unlike the project, which is ESM)
- `jest.setup.js` → setup file that runs before tests
